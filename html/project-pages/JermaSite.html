    <p>A video game livestreamer I follow (Jerma985) is infamous for being late, so I sought to make a website to log
        the delay between his announced times and his actual arrivals. I designed <a
                href="https://kgruich.github.io/JermaMissedMinutes.github.io/">the site</a> to near completion. I also
        designed a <a href="https://github.com/kgruich/JermaStreamForecastDiscordBot">JavaScipt program</a> (a "bot") to
        interact with Discord's messaging API to parse messages for times so
        that I could track announced times. </p>
    <p>Developing this website and associated bot helped me get adjusted to coding in HTML, CSS and some amount of
        JavaScript. It also gave me my first hands-on work with an API.</p>
    <p>The project
        is unfinished due to lacking the hardware or money to host a database. The database intermediary between the bot
        and website is the only lacking part of this project. I didn't return to this project because others were
        working on a similar website functionality, but I may still return to it since those other projects haven't been
        finished.</p>
